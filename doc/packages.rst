Packages
========

Packages are the core features to the Mw\\Http framework. Every app has the ability to customize the App to an amazing degree. In fact, the App itself has no functionality until it loads a package like the standard package.

Please have a look at the included packages:

- :doc:`packages/std`
- :doc:`packages/auto-args`
- :doc:`packages/plates`
- :doc:`packages/rest`
